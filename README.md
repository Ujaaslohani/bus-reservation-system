# bus-reservation-system
OUR AIM:-
To develop a project to implement a simple bus reservation system where the
user can perform tasks like insert bus information, reserve bus seat, show
reservation information and show information regarding the buses available. For
performing all these operations identify the proper data structure and analyse
their time complexity.
INTRODUCTION:-
The Bus Reservation System is an intricately crafted program designed to
revolutionize the efficiency of bus seat reservations. This report conducts a
comprehensive exploration of the provided C code, offering a detailed analysis
of its structure, functions, and proposing recommendations for optimization.
SCOPE OF PROJECT:-
The project encompasses the development of a console-based bus reservation
system, offering functionalities such as new bookings, seat availability
inquiries, ticket information, reservation cancellations, and a secure login
mechanism. While the current implementation serves as a foundation, there
exists ample opportunity for future enhancements, including the integration of
graphical user interfaces, databases, and additional features to further enrich the
user experience.
The subsequent sections of this report will delve Into the detailed design,
functionality, and code structure of the Bus Reservation System, providing
insights into its components and suggesting potential avenues for future
development.
